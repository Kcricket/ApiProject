# ApiProject

Project uploaded on pages: 
  https://kcricket.github.io/ApiProject/

I found this nice Anime Api:
  https://aniapi.com/
  
This project has:
  - Searchbar functions (strong: it searches by name in all database)
  - Onload, it fills the page whith animes
  - Infinite Scrollbar function (weak: animes repeat)
  - After you search, clicking the results will take you to a popup with the anime data

Posible Future Functionalities:
  - Clean the code
  - Making it prettier and mobile friendly
  - I Accept suggestions..Â¿?
